                <p>We are pleased to announce that the <b>Chat on GPT</b> event will be held on Tuesday, <b>18 April from 2 to 5 PM</b> (SGT)!
                  This is a hybrid workshop for both local students, faculty, administrators and members of the general public interested in learning about the technology of recent AI tools, their applications and their implications for learning, teaching and work.
                  This is a free event, open to the public in the online forum, and open to all members of NUS for on-site physical interaction.  Both forms of participation require registration.
                  It will be held in at <b>University Town (UTown) Auditorium 1</b>.

                <p>Due to fire code restrictions, our venue accommodates only a limited number of onsite participants.  Note that onsite registrations are limited to NUS staff, students and alumni.  However, we have plenty of capacity for virtual attendance for the general public.  Use the registration link above to register for either virtual or physical attendance.
