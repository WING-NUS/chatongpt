                <p>We are pleased to announce that the <b>Chat on GPT</b> event will be held on Tuesday, <b>18 April from 2 to 5 PM</b> (SGT)!
                  This is a hybrid workshop for both local students, faculty, administrators and members of the general public interested in learning about the technology of recent AI tools, their applications and their implications for learning, teaching and work.
                  This is a free event, open to the public in the online forum, and open to all members of NUS for on-site physical interaction.  Both forms of participation require registration.
                  It will be held in at <b>University Town (UTown) Auditorium 1</b>.

                <p>Due to fire code restrictions, our venue accommodates only a limited number of onsite participants.  Note that onsite registrations are limited to NUS staff, students and alumni.  However, we have plenty of capacity for virtual attendance for the general public.  Use the registration link above to register for either virtual or physical attendance.

                        <strong>Bio:</strong> Prof Martin HENZ is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore. He obtained his M.Sc. from the University of Stony Brook in 1992 and his Dr.rer.nat. from the Saarland University in 1997. He has been a research scientist at the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence. 
                        His current research and teaching revolves around the scalability of experiential learning. With his NUS colleagues, he has scaled the experiential course CS1101S (computer science introduction) from 48 students in 2012 to 670 students in 2021. He founded the experiential course CS4215 Programming Language Implementation, and offers experiential undergraduate software projects. He has published in a wide range of areas, including computer science and engineering education, programming languages, combinatorial search, and electric vehicles.
